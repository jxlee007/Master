viewport = a part/ frame of website visible in a full screen is known as viewport
fullscreen = device total height = 100 vh

whole website = div = main
main div will be divided into sections

note: this architecture is used in locomotive

if we don't know the height of web site would we should give height as auto in css

sections = screens = div

landing page = home = hero -> (section 1)
so we will give height as 100 vh as it would be visible as first frame on screen on our website

note: to download font direct from website goto inspect->network->font->open in new tab->save

div = nav   ->link
            ->h3

to remove underline from link use text decoration none
Text transform is used to capitilize text in uppercase

now we used jugaad to align h5 right side with h1 section by making class

we used remixicon for using icon in link of footer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ DAY 1

second section
for now add image and do display none so we can have image there but they can't disturb screen
and later on we will add effects 

rem size value make position static of object
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ DAY 2
if in css child div is absolute then you have to make parent div relative 
if you not do so then ex. our herofooter was lost when script.js applied 

smooth scrolling 
    ✅ attach loco scroll css 
    ✅ attach locomotive scroll min js 
    ✅ some code from loco github for js 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DAY 3

 Add function for making circle div follow with delay of 1sec 
 delay was added in css
 functionality -> we take co-ordinates of cursor as data on the html doc in browser (note full screen = that why used client)
 and then pass to circle div so it can track cursor on html doc

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DAY 4
